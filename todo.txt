Add a possibility to easily create loggers inside functions with the function name in a logger.
So any function has the __name__ attribute, and I wanna somehow utilize this to simply create
a logger and so it could automatically take the name of the function to not do it by hand.
It can simplify the debugging, as not only the root class will have the name, but loggers of
any function of this class.
